You're doing fine.

You need to install:

pip
django charit 
south

Then I don't think there should be problems from here on.

To access the Admin interface, go to localhost:9000/admin

Login in using "developer" and "password"

See that "docs" folder for some vital documentation files.
Read on Django on django website, then I can explain things to you later.

CAREFUL NOTE: 
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO ON YOUR PC IN THIS DIRECTORY. DON'T ALTER OR DELETE ANY OF THE FILES I SENT TO YOU VIA DROPBOX, IF YOU DO, THEY ARE ALSO DELETED FROM MY PC INSTANTLY. AND I AM NOT MAKING BACK-UPS AS I DONT HAVE SPACE ON MY COMPUTER.
